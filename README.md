**1. Service Item Details and Private Access :** Users can explore various service items on the home page. When they click on a service item's details button, they are prompted to log in or register because service item details are private. This ensures that only authorized users can access detailed information about your services.


**2. Multiple Sign-Up Methods :** The sign-up page offers users four different methods to create an account: email and password, Google login, Twitter login, and GitHub login. This provides users with flexibility and convenience when registering on your website.

**3. Cart and Booking System :** Users can add service items to their cart from the service item details page. The cart page displays all added items along with their prices. Users have the option to remove all items from the cart or proceed to book the selected items. This feature streamlines the booking process and allows users to review their selections before finalizing their bookings.

**4. Empty Cart Animation :**
If a user visits the cart page without adding any items to their cart, the page displays an empty message along with an animation. This user-friendly feature informs users that their cart is empty and encourages them to explore and add items.
